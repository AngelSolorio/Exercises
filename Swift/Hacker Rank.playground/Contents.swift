// Title: Grading Students
// Instructions: HackerLand University has the following grading policy:
// -> Every student receives a grade in the inclusive range from 0 to 100.
// -> Any gtrade less than 40 is a failing grade.
// Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's grade according to these rules:
// -> If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, round grade up to the next multiple of 5.
// -> If the value of grade is less than 38, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.
// For example, gtrade = 84 will be rounded to 85 but grade = 29 will not be rounded because the rounding would result in a number that is less than 40.

// Title: Kangaroo
// Instructions: You are choreographing a circus show with various animals. For one act, you are given two kangaroos on a number line ready to jump in the positive direction (i.e, toward positive infinity).
//  -> The first kangaroo starts at location x1 and moves at a rate of v1 meters per jump.
//  -> The second kangaroo starts at location x2 and moves at a rate of v2 meters per jump.
//  You have to figure out a way to get both kangaroos at the same location at the same time as part of the show. If it is possible, return YES, otherwise return NO.

// Title: Between Two Sets
// Instructions: You will be given two arrays of integers and asked to determine all integers that satisfy the following two conditions:
//  -> The elements of the first array are all factors of the integer being considered
//  -> The integer being considered is a factor of all elements of the second array
//  These numbers are referred to as being between the two arrays. You must determine how many such numbers exist.
