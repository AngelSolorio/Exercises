// Title: Grading Students
// Instructions: HackerLand University has the following grading policy:
// -> Every student receives a grade in the inclusive range from 0 to 100.

// -> If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, round grade up to the next multiple of 5.
// -> If the value of grade is less than 38, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.
// For example, gtrade = 84 will be rounded to 85 but grade = 29 will not be rounded because the rounding would result in a number that is less than 40.

// Title: Counting Valleys
// Instructions: Gary tracks his hikes meticulously, paying close attention to small details like topography. During his last hike he took exactly n steps. For every step he took, he noted if it was an uphill, U, or a downhill, D step. Gary's hikes start and end at sea level and each step up or down represents a 1 unit change in altitude. We define the following terms:
//  -> A mountain is a sequence of consecutive steps above sea level, starting with a step up from sea level and ending with a step down to sea level.
//  -> A valley is a sequence of consecutive steps below sea level, starting with a step down from sea level and ending with a step up to sea level.
